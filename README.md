# Understanding Approximating Polynomials

This repo contains a PDF report I prepared as part of my Numerical Analysis coursework.  
All figures and plots were generated in Python by me.

The report introduces and compares different polynomial approximation methods for functions, highlighting their theory, applications, and limitations.
